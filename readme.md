# PyDie
PyDie is a simple Python GUI application for rolling dice and flipping coins. Originally built as a learning experience in Python GUIs and tkinter, the project has since been moved to PyQt. 

Development is continuing to flesh out the interface and usability using the much nicer PyQt framework.
